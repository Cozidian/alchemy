In the 2024 United States presidential election, President Joe Biden initially pursued re-election but withdrew from the race on July 21, 2024. His decision followed a widely criticized debate performance against former President Donald Trump on June 27, which intensified concerns about his age and cognitive abilities. Subsequently, prominent Democrats urged him to step aside.
