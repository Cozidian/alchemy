Since assuming office in January 2025, President Donald Trump has implemented a series of assertive policies that reflect his administration's priorities:

Trade and Tariffs

On February 1, 2025, President Trump signed executive orders imposing a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on imports from China. A lower 10% tariff was applied specifically to Canadian energy exports, including electricity, natural gas, and oil, to "minimize any disruptive effects." In response, Mexico and Canada announced plans for retaliatory tariffs. However, on February 3, Trump agreed to pause these tariffs for one month after both countries pledged to enhance efforts to prevent drug trafficking into the United States.

Foreign Policy Initiatives

President Trump has proposed using American resources to take over and reconstruct Gaza, suggesting relocating Palestinians and transforming the area into a luxurious destination under long-term U.S. control. This plan, along with threats to reclaim U.S. control of the Panama Canal and the idea of purchasing Greenland from Denmark, has surprised even his allies. Many question the feasibility and intent behind these declarations, with concerns about both practicality and international law. Despite widespread criticism, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remain firm in their support of the proposal.

Domestic Policy and Cultural Issues

Domestically, the administration has taken steps to dismantle "diversity, equity, and inclusion" initiatives, redefine gender norms to align with biological sex, and restrict transgender athletes' participation in women's sports. Additionally, anti-abortion policies have been reinstated, and pro-life activists previously targeted by the prior administration have received pardons. Efforts are also underway to combat the fentanyl crisis by designating certain cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. The administration is pursuing antitrust actions against major social media platforms to address concerns about censorship and promote free speech.

Alignment with Project 2025

Many of these actions align with "Project 2025," a conservative policy agenda developed to guide a potential second Trump term. Despite initially distancing himself from this project during the campaign, President Trump's early executive actions have closely mirrored its proposals, signaling a shift toward more autocratic governance. This includes changes in federal hiring practices, education policies favoring private school vouchers, and significant reductions in foreign aid.

These developments indicate a continuation and intensification of President Trump's previous policy approaches, with a focus on assertive trade measures, interventionist foreign policy, and conservative domestic reforms.
