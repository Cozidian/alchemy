Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 United States presidential election can be attributed to several key factors:

1. Economic Concerns

Economic issues, particularly inflation, were central to voter concerns. Despite improvements in traditional economic metrics, many Americans continued to feel economic strain. Trump's messaging on economic recovery resonated with these voters, who felt that the Biden administration had not adequately addressed their financial challenges.

2. Immigration Policy

Immigration was a significant issue in the election. Trump's firm stance on border security and immigration control appealed to voters concerned about illegal immigration and its perceived impact on the economy and national security. This contrasted with Harris's more lenient immigration policies, leading many voters to favor Trump's approach.

3. Demographic Shifts

Trump made notable gains among working-class voters, particularly young men, those without college degrees, and Hispanic voters. His campaign effectively utilized alternative media platforms, such as podcasts and online influencers, to reach these demographics, broadening his appeal beyond the traditional Republican base.

4. Anti-Incumbent Sentiment

The 2024 election occurred amid a global trend of anti-incumbent sentiment, with voters expressing dissatisfaction with current leadership. Trump positioned himself as a change candidate, capitalizing on this desire for new leadership and distancing himself from the perceived shortcomings of the incumbent administration.
